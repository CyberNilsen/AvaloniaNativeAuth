## üß© Native Authentication Binaries for Avalonia (.NET)

AvaloniaNativeAuth provides ready-to-use native authentication programs for Windows and macOS, enabling Avalonia and other .NET desktop apps to securely use Touch ID or Windows Hello for local user authentication ‚Äî without needing direct OS-specific bindings.

## üöÄ Overview

Avalonia doesn‚Äôt directly expose native biometric APIs on macOS or Windows.
This repository solves that by including small native executables that your .NET app can call to perform OS-level authentication, then return a simple exit code indicating success or failure.

These binaries can be called from Avalonia (or any .NET 6+) project using System.Diagnostics.Process.
